        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>
          “Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think
          better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful
          in all domains.” - Bill Gates

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most important aspects of becoming a Web Developer is
          learning to use a programming language. While some web developers use
          C++ or Javascript to build a website, a basic understanding of
          Javascript is essential for an excellent job. There are many free
          online tutorials for Javascript, but making something from scratch is
          the best way to gain a solid understanding of this language. If you're
          unsure about Javascript, you can always look at one of the many
          websites built in it.

          left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away” - Antonie
